# React Strict Mode

- `React.StrictMode`` is a tool provided by React that helps developers write better quality code by highlighting potential problems during development.
- In react18 StrictMode is by default turned on and React renders each component twice but in production it will only render one time.

```
<React.StrictMode>
    <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```
